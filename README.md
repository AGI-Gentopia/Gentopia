# Gentopia 
*The Collective Growth of Intelligent Agents.*

Gentopia is a lightweight and extensible framework for LLM driven autonomous Agent. It provides multiple essential components to build, test and evaluate agents. At its core, Gentopia aims to embody agents with single config files, thus minimizing your effort in maintaining, tuning, and sharing agents.

Gentopia maintains a agent zoo [GentPool](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/GentPool) to share public agents specialized for different tasks. In this platform, you could easily call other agents for interaction, extend and optimize agent components towards your needs. You can also publish your specialized agent to get our unique benchmark eval and share your agent with the world. 

There's no universal rule to optimize agents, but a platform enabling *agent specialization, sharing, and interaction* is the golden path to some greater intelligence, a belief guiding us to build Gentopia.

## Core Features 💡

## Build with us 

Participate in this Utopia of superintelligence and help it grows! As a fully open-source project, we develop under public advice, ideas, and supervision. Meanwhile, here are ways you may contribute to Gentopia.

- 🐛 Post an [issue](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia/issues) requesting necessary bug fixes, additional features, or roadmap suggestions. (Check closed ones first)
- 🎯 Our dev team meets weekly to groom [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Gentopia-AI/projects/1) into tickets. While we work on them, you can pick up others and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia/pulls) to request a merge. We always welcome new members in this way.
- 🤝 Share your specialized agent to [GentPool](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/GentPool)! Create an Agent PR ([example]()) to merge your well-tuned agent into the pool. This allows others to use or build upon your agent. 
- ⭐ Help us spread! Give us a star, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GentopiaAI), join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ASPP9MY9QK), and share with your friends!
