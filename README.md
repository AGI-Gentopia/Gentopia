# Gentopia 
*The Collective Growth of Intelligent Agents.*

Gentopia is a lightweight and extensible framework for LLM driven autonomous Agent. It provides multiple essential components to build, test and evaluate agents. At its core, Gentopia aims to embody agents with single config files, thus minimizing your effort in maintaining, tuning, and sharing agents.

Gentopia maintains an agent zoo [GentPool](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/GentPool) to share public agents specialized for different tasks. In this platform, you could easily call other agents for interaction, extend and optimize agent components towards your needs. You can also publish your specialized agent to get our unique benchmark eval and share your agent with the world. 

## Motivation
Think of building a *real* AI assistant. Do we really need a >> 175B GPT-4 to summarize Web search or `print("helloworld")`? Recent studies like [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12726), [Specializing Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12726), [Let's Verify SbS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050), [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323), etc. point us towards an intuitive yet undervalued direction 👉 

```
An LLM is more capable if you create a context/distribution shift narrowed to some target tasks.
```
Sadly, there is no silver bullet for agent specialization. For example, you can 
- Simply add `Let's think step by step.` in your **prompt** for more accurate Math QA.
- Give a **few-shot** exemplar in your prompt to guide an efficient and correct reasoning trajectory for plotting novels.
- Supervise **fine-tuning*** (SFT) your 70B `llama2` like [Let's Verify Step by Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050) for close or superior Math capability than 175B GPT-3.5.
- Optimize your LLM-Plugin interaction **paradigm** like this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diJ4IDaT4Z4) to easily half the execution time for Seach & Summarize.
- And more ...

Isn't that beautiful if one shares his specialized intelligence, allowing others to reproduce, build on, or interact with it at ease? 🤗

This belief inspires us to build Gentopia, **a convenient framework for agent *specialization, sharing, and interaction,* encouraging collective growth to greater intelligence**.

## Build with us 

Participate in this Utopia of superintelligence and help it grows! As a fully open-source project, we develop under public advice, ideas, and supervision. Meanwhile, here are ways you may contribute to Gentopia.

- 🐛 Post an [issue](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia/issues) requesting necessary bug fixes, additional features, or roadmap suggestions. (Check closed ones first)
- 🎯 Our dev team meets weekly to groom [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Gentopia-AI/projects/1) into tickets. While we work on them, you can pick up others and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia/pulls) to request a merge. We always welcome new members in this way.
- 🤝 Share your specialized agent to [GentPool](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/GentPool)! Create an Agent PR ([example]()) to merge your well-tuned agent into the pool. This allows others to use or build upon your agent. 
- ⭐ Help us spread! Give us a star, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GentopiaAI), join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ASPP9MY9QK), and share with your friends!
