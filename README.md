# Gentopia 

Gentopia is a lightweight and extensible framework for LLM driven autonomous Agent. It provides multiple essential components to build, test and evaluate agents. At its core, Gentopia aims to embody agents with single config files, thus minimizing your effort in maintaining, tuning and sharing agents.

Gentopia maintains a pool [GentPool](https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/GentPool) to share public agents specialized for different tasks. In this platform, you could easily call other agents for interaction, extend and optimize agent components towards your own needs. You can also publish your specialized agent to get our unique benchmark eval and share your agent to the world. 

There's no universal rule to optimize agents, but we believe that agent *specialization, sharing and interaction* is the golden path navigating the **Collective Growth of Superintelligence**.
