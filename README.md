# Gentopia 
(⚠️Under Construction 👷‍♂️🛠️. Check out our [Vision](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qO2BdBk7zwx9wxGb2iryuAsg0M9AUcldz5SPos8YFSE/edit#slide=id.p))
The brain of Agents. It uses a strong LLM for chained reasoning, whereas each reasoning step is assigned to an config-driven, lightweight and specialzed Agent from Gentopia-AI/GentPool.

- Gentopia, should provide various stable base LLMs, including API-driven ones like `gpt-4`, and open LLMs.
- Gentopia should provide well-organized prompt template supporting in-context instructions everywhere.
- Gentoia should provide a high level Data Model to be passed across multiple Agent calls.

- At wiring time, Gentopia is fully config-driven, thereby should provide a config parser to set up the whole graph.
